[INTERNAL]
F        = 820.428   	# [pixel] Focal length.
SX       = 1.0		# [pixel] Pixel size in X direction of the image.
SY       = 1.000283	# [pixel] Pixel size in Y direction of the image.
X0       = 305.278	# [pixel] X-coordinate of principle (from top-left origin of the image).
Y0       = 239.826	# [pixel] Y-coordinate of principle (from top-left origin of the image).

[EXTERNAL]
B        = 0.308084	# [m] Width of the baseline of the stereo camera rig.
LATPOS   = -0.07	# [m] Lateral position of rectified images, giving origin of camera coordinate system. Described in world coordinate system already!
HEIGHT   = 1.26		# [m] Altitudinal position of rectified images, giving origin of camera coordinate system. Described in world coordinate system already!
DISTANCE = 2.0		# [m] Longitudinal position of rectified images, giving origin of camera coordinate system. Described in world coordinate system already!
TILT     = 0.06 	# [rad] Tilt angle of the cameras.
YAW      = 0.01	        # [rad] Yaw angle of the cameras.
ROLL     = 0.0		# [rad] Roll angle of the cameras.

# Note:
#  In a stereo camera system the internal parameters for both cameras are the
#  same.
